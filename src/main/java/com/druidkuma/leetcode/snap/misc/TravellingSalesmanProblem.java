/**
 * 1) Brute Force: Try all possible permutations of the cities and calculate the total distance for each route. This approach is not feasible for large inputs due to its factorial time complexity
 * 2) Dynamic Programming: This approach (Held-Karp algorithm) uses a bitmask and DP table to record the shortest paths between subsets of cities. The time complexity is 
 * ùëÇ(2ùëõ√óùëõ2), which is better but still exponential.
 * 3) Greedy Approximation: Use heuristics like the Nearest Neighbor or Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) to find approximate solutions quickly. This approach is suboptimal but runs in
 * O(n2), which is faster for large inputs.
 * 4) Genetic Algorithm or Simulated Annealing: These are meta-heuristic approaches that search for approximate solutions over multiple iterations.
